# Project state

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01, AI agent, Phase 03 implementation session
(autonomous Phase 03→11 run, authorized after the `TEAM-EXECUTION-PLAN.md`
planning checkpoint).
**Statuses used:** `NOT_STARTED` · `PLANNED` · `IN_PROGRESS` · `BLOCKED` · `READY_FOR_REVIEW` · `VERIFIED` · `COMPLETE`

## Current phase

**Phase 00 — Foundation.** Status: `VERIFIED`.
**Phase 01 — Data model & migrations.** Status: `VERIFIED`.
**Phase 02 — Synthetic operational data.** Status: `VERIFIED`. Database
holds 17 equipment / 22 checkouts / 192 usage_logs across the exact
official 7-row Caterpillar sample plus a synthetic trailing-history and
live-active-checkout layer. See
[`phases/PHASE-02-synthetic-data.md`](phases/PHASE-02-synthetic-data.md).

**Planning checkpoint (between Phase 02 and 03)** — `TEAM-EXECUTION-PLAN.md`
+ `CITADEL-ARCHITECTURE-TEAM-PLAN.pdf`: final architecture diagrams,
4-person work division, phase/dependency map, presentation split, panel
defense prep. No architecture or schema change.

**Phase 03 — Core backend APIs.** Status: `VERIFIED`. `equipment/`,
`checkouts/`, `usage-logs/` modules built, tested (14/14 tests pass), and
manually verified against the running server. Database counts confirmed
unchanged after tests (17/22/192 — test fixtures are created and deleted
per-test, never touching the seeded rows). See
[`phases/PHASE-03-core-apis.md`](phases/PHASE-03-core-apis.md).

**Phase 04 — Alerts engine.** Status: `VERIFIED`. `GET /api/alerts`
recomputes and syncs `overdue`/`upcoming_return`/`missing_info` from live
`checkouts` data on every read (16/16 tests pass, incl. Phase 03's).
Seeded `EQX3001`/`EQX3002`/`EQX3003` each produce exactly the expected
alert. See [`phases/PHASE-04-alerts.md`](phases/PHASE-04-alerts.md).

**Phases 05-11:** `NOT_STARTED`. 05 (anomalies), 06 (forecasting), and 08
(Asset Dashboard UI) are all unblocked now — see `ROADMAP.md`'s
dependency graph.

## Next recommended action

Continuing the authorized autonomous Phase 03→11 run: **Phase 05
(anomaly detection)** next — `phases/PHASE-05-anomaly-detection.md`, one
of the two highest-judging-weight modules.

## Overall progress

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Team access | `VERIFIED` | 1 of 3 invites accepted (`eklavaya008`); 2 pending — `RISK-002` |
| Foundation | `VERIFIED` | Phase 00 |
| Docker Compose | `READY_FOR_REVIEW` | Still not run end-to-end — `RISK-001` |
| AI-agent operating system | `VERIFIED` | Phase 00 |
| Problem statement received & analyzed | `VERIFIED` | 2 sources, both confirmed authoritative |
| Data model | `VERIFIED` | Phase 01 |
| Synthetic data | `VERIFIED` | Phase 02 — 17 equipment, 22 checkouts, 192 usage_logs seeded and verified |
| Anomaly threshold calibration | `RESOLVED` | 0.40 idle-ratio threshold validated against real seeded data — `DECISIONS.md` |
| Forecasting method calibration | `NOT_STARTED` | Still pending Phase 06 task 06.1 — `Q-002` |
| Requirements | `IMPLEMENTED` (partial) | REQ-001–005, REQ-018 `VERIFIED`; REQ-015 `IMPLEMENTED`; rest `NOT_STARTED` |
| Phase plan | `VERIFIED` | 11 phases in `ROADMAP.md`; work division in `TEAM-EXECUTION-PLAN.md` |
| Core backend APIs (equipment/checkouts/usage-logs) | `VERIFIED` | Phase 03 — 14/14 tests pass |
| Alerts engine | `VERIFIED` | Phase 04 — 16/16 tests pass |
| Product implementation | `IN_PROGRESS` | Phases 00-04 done; Phases 05-11 not started |

## Known bugs

None open. See `ISSUES.md`.

## Known risks

- `RISK-001`: Docker Compose stack untested end-to-end.
- `RISK-002`: 2 of 3 invited teammates haven't accepted GitHub access yet.
- `RISK-003`: **Partially resolved.** Anomaly/idle threshold half
  confirmed sound against real seeded data (`DECISIONS.md`). Forecasting-
  method half (moving average vs. exponential smoothing) still open —
  Phase 06 task 06.1.

## What must not be changed without a documented reason

- The core stack choice (React/Express/PostgreSQL, no ORM).
- Rule-based analytics over a trained ML model — see `DECISIONS.md`.
- The schema's nullable `checkouts.site_id`/`checkouts.operator_id`.
- The 0.40 idle-ratio anomaly threshold — now validated against real data (`DECISIONS.md`); don't casually retune it without new evidence.
- The seeded data's deliberate edge cases (`EQX3001`–`EQX3005`, the `Grader`/`S001` sparse-history pair) — Phase 04/05/06/09 tests and demo depend on these existing exactly as seeded. Don't overwrite them by re-running seed against a wiped-then-different dataset without updating this state.
- `server/.env` — real local DB credentials, never commit it.
